# Stacks - First in, Last out, Linear Data structure (Hashsets(dict, sets), Trees(BST, RBT,A*), Graphs)
# - Adding Data to the top - "push"
# - Retrieving the top element - "pop"
# - Returning the top element(Doesn't remove it) - "peek"
# - Count of elements in stack - "len"

# Stack implemented as linked list
# Resizing array, stack implemented with list
stack = []
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)
stack.append(4)
print(stack[-1])  # peek
# The point of stack is the limitations of list(only the four operations used with stack - append, pop)

# Queues -  First in, First out, abstract data type, data structure
# - Creating queues
# - Adding elements
# - Removing elements

# Priority queue - Most optimal out
